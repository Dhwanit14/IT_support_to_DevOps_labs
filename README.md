🧪 IT Support to DevOps Labs

This is my personal collection of hands-on labs focused on real-world IT support and system administration issues. Each lab simulates a ticket or scenario I might face as a Helpdesk Technician, Junior Sysadmin, or future DevOps Engineer.

All labs were completed on my own Windows Server + Client virtual lab.


📚 Lab Index

Each lab includes:  
✅ A realistic issue scenario  
🛠️ Tools used to troubleshoot  
📘 Notes and logs (Event Viewer, services, permissions, etc.)  
✅ Final fix and explanation
