 🧪 Lab 2: Access Denied to Shared Folder – NTFS vs Share Permissions

 📝 Summary

Simulated a real-world access issue where user `jthomas`, a member of the `Marketing` group, was denied access to a shared folder over the network. The issue was traced to misconfigured NTFS or Share permissions and resolved using best practices.


 🎯 Scenario

> "User `jthomas` is trying to access the shared folder `\\ServerName\DeptDocs` and receives an 'Access Denied' error. The folder should be accessible to all members of the `Marketing` group."



 🛠️ Environment

| Component     | Details                         |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Server        | Windows Server 2019 (DC + File Server) |
| Client        | Windows 10 domain-joined VM     |
| Domain        | `DHWANIT.LOCAL`                 |
| Shared Folder | `C:\Shares\DeptDocs`            |



 🧰 Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **ADUC (dsa.msc)** | Created user `jthomas` and `Marketing` group |
| **File Explorer (Shift + Right-click)** | Tested access using "Run as different user" |
| **Effective Access (Security tab)** | Verified calculated permissions |
| **Folder Properties** | Configured NTFS and Share permissions |
| **CMD + `runas`** | Launched Explorer as `jthomas` for testing |



 🔍 Root Cause

The `DeptDocs` folder had either:

- NTFS permissions that did **not include the `Marketing` group**
- Or Share permissions limited to certain users/groups

Because **effective permissions = most restrictive of NTFS and Share**, the user was blocked at one or both levels.


 🧪 Steps Taken

 1. Created Folder and User Environment

- Created shared folder: `C:\Shares\DeptDocs`
- Shared it as: `\\ServerName\DeptDocs`
- Created user `jthomas`, added to group `Marketing`

 2. Simulated the Access Denied Issue

- From client PC
