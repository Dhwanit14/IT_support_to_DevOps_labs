 üß™ Lab 6: DHCP Troubleshooting ‚Äì IP Conflict Simulation

 üìù Summary

In this lab, I simulated a real-world DHCP issue where two devices on the same network use the same IP address. This causes an IP conflict, and usually results in loss of connectivity. I used a DHCP-assigned client and a manually configured static IP to recreate the problem, then resolved it by correcting the IP configuration.



 üéØ Scenario

> "A user cannot connect to the network. Another user is also experiencing intermittent disconnects. You suspect an IP conflict caused by a static address within the DHCP range."



 üõ†Ô∏è Environment

| Component         | Details                            |

| DHCP Server       | Domain Controller (10.180.33.101)  |
| Scope Range       | 10.180.33.100 ‚Äì 10.180.33.200      |
| Client VM         | Windows 10 (used DHCP)             |
| Second VM         | Windows 10 (set static IP manually)|



 üß∞ Tools Used

| Tool        | Purpose                                  |

| ipconfig    | To release/renew IP addresses            |
| arp -a      | To view IP-to-MAC mapping                |
| Event Viewer| To check for IP conflict logs (ID 4199)  |
| DHCP Console| To configure scope and monitor leases    |
| Virtual Network Manager | To confirm VM NIC setup      |



 üß™ Steps Performed

1. On DHCP Server (DC):
   - Created scope: 10.180.33.100 ‚Äì 10.180.33.200
   - Router: 10.180.33.1
   - DNS: 10.180.33.101
   - Authorized and activated scope

2. On Client VM A:
   - Set to ‚ÄúObtain IP address automatically‚Äù
   - Used ipconfig /renew to get 10.180.33.100 from DHCP

3. On Client VM B:
   - Manually configured static IP: 10.180.33.100 (same as VM A)
   - Subnet: 255.255.255.0
   - Gateway: 10.180.33.1
   - DNS: 10.180.33.101

4. Monitored network behavior:
   - No error popup appeared (expected in some VM setups)
   - Loss of ping or inconsistent connectivity between devices

5. Ran arp -a to inspect MAC ‚Üí IP mappings
   - Saw that both machines claimed same IP

6. Resolved conflict:
   - Switched static client back to DHCP
   - Or changed static IP to 10.180.33.250 (outside DHCP range)
   - Re-ran ipconfig /renew on Client A



 üîç Logs Observed

- Event Viewer did not show ID 4199 or 1001 in this case
- Behavior confirmed through networking tools (arp, ipconfig)



 ‚úÖ Final Outcome

- DHCP successfully assigned unique IPs to dynamic clients
- IP conflict was simulated and resolved
- Network stability restored after static IP moved out of scope



 üß† Lessons Learned

- DHCP ranges should never overlap with static IPs
- Always check Event Viewer, arp, and ipconfig to verify network behavior
- In virtual labs, not all conflict messages appear ‚Äî but the issue still exists
- Best practice: reserve IPs in DHCP or use static IPs outside the scope
