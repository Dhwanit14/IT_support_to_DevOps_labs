🧪 Lab 5: AD Password Reset + Locked Account Troubleshooting

 📝 Summary

In this lab, I simulated a common support case where a user account is locked after too many failed login attempts. I tested the full workflow — from triggering the lockout to auditing the logs, unlocking the account, and resetting the password.



 🎯 Scenario

> "User jthomas says they cannot log in. They receive a message that their account is locked. I need to verify the lockout, reset their password, and get them working again."



 🛠️ Environment

## 🛠️ Environment

| Component        | Details                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Domain           | DHWANIT.LOCAL               |
| Domain Controller| Windows Server 2019         |
| Client           | Windows 10 (domain-joined)  |
| Test User        | jthomas (under Marketing OU)|

## 🧰 Tools Used

| Tool                                 | Purpose                                      |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) | To unlock the user and reset password |
| Group Policy Management (gpmc.msc)   | To configure lockout policy and auditing     |
| gpupdate                             | To apply policy changes                      |
| Event Viewer (Security log)          | To view lockout Event ID 4740                |
| Client login screen                  | To test failed logins and trigger lockout    |



 🧪 Steps Performed

1. Set lockout policy using Group Policy:
   - Lockout threshold = 3 attempts
   - Lockout duration = 15 minutes
   - Reset counter after = 5 minutes

2. Enabled auditing of account lockouts:
   - GPO > Advanced Audit Policy > Audit Account Lockout (Success)

3. Ran gpupdate /force on DC and client VM  
4. Tried logging in as jthomas with wrong password 5+ times  
   → Account locked with this message:
   > “The referenced account is currently locked out.”

5. Verified in ADUC:
   - jthomas account showed “Account is locked out” checked

6. Opened Event Viewer on DC:
   - Filtered Security log for Event ID 4740
   - Confirmed log:
     - Target User: jthomas
     - Caller Computer: client VM name
     - Time of lockout

7. In ADUC:
   - Unlocked the account
   - Reset password to Secret66
   - Unchecked “User must change password at next login” (for testing)

8. Logged in on client successfully using new password



 🔍 Logs Observed

| Event ID | Meaning |
|-||
| 4740 | Account lockout event |
| 4624 | Successful logon |
| 4634 | Logoff event |

These helped me understand when the lock happened and from where.



 ✅ Outcome

- Account was locked from failed login attempts  
- Event 4740 appeared with full lockout details  
- Password reset and login tested successfully



 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Account lockout policy is not active by default — it must be set via GPO
- 4740 event logs are essential for finding where lockouts come from
- Unlocking and resetting passwords are daily tasks in IT support
- Always test lockouts on both DC and client to ensure GPO is applying correctly
