 🧪 Lab 8: Simulated Ticketing System – iTop

 📝 Summary

In this lab, I installed and configured the iTop open-source ITSM platform in my local lab. I used it to simulate 5 real-world helpdesk tickets that I’ve already performed in previous labs — following a full incident workflow: ticket creation, assignment, troubleshooting steps, resolution, and ticket closure.



 🛠️ Environment

| Component             | Details                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| iTop Version         | iTop Community Edition (local)   |
| Platform             | Installed on Windows Server (DC) |
| Access URL           | http://localhost/itop            |
| Database             | MySQL via XAMPP                  |


 🔧 Installation Steps

1. Installed XAMPP on the Domain Controller (Apache + MySQL + PHP)
2. Downloaded iTop Community Edition from combodo.com
3. Extracted iTop to C:\xampp\htdocs\itop
4. Created MySQL database via phpMyAdmin: database name itop
5. Visited http://localhost/itop/setup to complete web installer
6. Configured default admin account and logged in

✅ iTop was successfully installed and accessed locally.


 🎫 Simulated Tickets (based on previous labs)

| Ticket ID | Issue Summary                                | Status     | Related Lab |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|
| TKT-001   | User unable to log in due to password flag   | Closed     | Lab 1       |
| TKT-002   | Access denied to shared Marketing folder      | Closed     | Lab 2       |
| TKT-003   | User account locked after failed attempts     | Closed     | Lab 5       |
| TKT-004   | Printer not working due to Print Spooler stop | Closed     | Lab 4 & 7   |
| TKT-005   | DHCP client failed to get IP – conflict found | Closed     | Lab 6       |

Each ticket included:
- Summary and category
- User (caller) and assigned technician (me)
- Notes from diagnosis
- Resolution actions
- Final status: Closed


🧠 What I Practiced

- Creating tickets manually in iTop as Incident → User Request
- Filling in proper ticket fields: Title, Priority, Category, User, Impact
- Updating Worklog entries during each troubleshooting step
- Assigning tickets to myself (as technician)
- Changing status: New → Assigned → Resolved → Closed




 📘 Lessons Learned

- Ticketing systems like iTop simulate real IT team workflows
- Each lab ticket helped me practice documentation and workflow tracking
- Good ticket habits = clear communication for users, coworkers, and audits
- Even in self-study, building a habit of logging steps improves troubleshooting
