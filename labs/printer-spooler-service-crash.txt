🧪 Lab 4: Printer Not Working – Print Spooler Service Crash

📝 Summary

In this lab, I simulated a real-world printer problem where the Print Spooler service stops, and print jobs don’t work. I used a built-in printer (Microsoft XPS Document Writer) to test how Windows handles print jobs and what happens when the spooler is stopped.



 🎯 Scenario

> “User clicks print, but nothing happens. There’s no error message. Printer appears normal.”

This is common in offices when the print spooler service crashes. In this lab, I recreated this issue and fixed it.



 🛠️ What I Used

- Windows 10 Client VM
- Built-in printer: Microsoft XPS Document Writer
- Tools:
  - Control Panel → Devices and Printers
  - services.msc (to stop/start Print Spooler)
  - Event Viewer → Application Log



 🧪 What I Did

1. Opened Control Panel → Devices and Printers  
2. Found Microsoft XPS Document Writer and set it as the default printer  
3. Opened Printer Properties → Clicked Print Test Page  
4. Opened the print queue (See what’s printing) — it was empty at first  
5. Went to services.msc → Stopped the Print Spooler service  
6. Tried to print again → nothing worked (simulated the “broken printer”)  
7. Started the Print Spooler again → tested printing → now it worked  
8. Checked Event Viewer → looked for spooler-related events under Application logs



 🔍 What I Saw

- When Print Spooler is stopped:
  - Print jobs don’t appear
  - Printer test page fails silently
- After restarting the service:
  - Printer works again
  - The print queue becomes responsive
- In Event Viewer:
  - Saw logs under Application (Event ID 7031 or similar may appear — depends on timing)



 ✅ Final Result

- Simulated a printer failure without a real printer
- Learned how to:
  - Restart Print Spooler
  - Use built-in printers for testing
  - Check Event Viewer logs for printer issues



 🧠 Lessons Learned

- Print Spooler is critical for all Windows printing
- When it’s off, users usually don’t get a clear error — it “just doesn’t work”
- Event Viewer and services.msc are key tools to fix this quickly
- Even with no real printer, I can test printing behavior using built-in options
