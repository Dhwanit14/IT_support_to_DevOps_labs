 üß™ Lab 3: Group Policy Misconfiguration ‚Äì User Cannot Log In

 üìù Summary

Simulated a real-world scenario where user `jthomas`, placed in the `Marketing` OU, was unable to log in due to a misconfigured Group Policy. This lab demonstrates how to identify, analyze, and correct a GPO that unintentionally blocks interactive logon.



 üéØ Scenario

> "User `jthomas` cannot log in to their domain-joined PC. This issue started after a Group Policy update. Other users are not affected."



 üõ†Ô∏è Environment

| Component     | Details                            |
||-|
| Domain        | `DHWANIT.LOCAL`                    |
| DC VM         | Windows Server 2019 (with AD + GPMC) |
| Client VM     | Windows 10 (domain-joined)         |
| User          | `jthomas` (located in `Marketing` OU) |
| GPO Name      | `DenyNonAdminLogon` (or your custom name) |



 üß∞ Tools Used

| Tool           | Purpose |
|-||
| GPMC       | Linked and modified GPOs, checked filtering and scope |
| gpresult   | Verified which GPOs were applied to `jthomas` |
| Event Viewer | Checked for logon failures or GPO processing errors |
| ADUC       | Verified group membership and OU location |
| rsop.msc (optional) | Reviewed resultant policy on client |



 üîç Root Cause

The GPO `DenyNonAdminLogon` was linked to the `Marketing` OU and configured to:
- Deny log on locally for `Domain Users`
- Or Allow log on locally only for `Administrators`

Since `jthomas` is not an administrator and is a member of `Domain Users`, they were effectively blocked from interactive logon by the Group Policy.




üß™ Steps Taken


 1. Created GPO to Simulate Misconfiguration

- Created GPO: `DenyNonAdminLogon`
- Configured:
Computer Configuration ‚Üí
Policies ‚Üí
Windows Settings ‚Üí
Security Settings ‚Üí
Local Policies ‚Üí
User Rights Assignment ‚Üí
Deny log on locally ‚Üí Domain Users


- Linked GPO to the `Marketing` OU
- Forced policy update with `gpupdate /force`



 2. Tested Login

- Tried logging in as `jthomas` on the client VM
- Login failed with message:  
> "The sign-in method you're trying to use isn't allowed..."



 3. Investigated the Issue

- On client:
- Ran `gpresult /r` ‚Üí confirmed the GPO `DenyNonAdminLogon` was applied
- Verified that user is part of `Domain Users`
- On DC:
- Used GPMC to confirm GPO was scoped to Marketing OU
- Used Event Viewer ‚Üí `Security` log ‚Üí Event ID 4625 was absent (not a failed authentication)
- Used `Effective Access` to test resulting permissions for `jthomas`



 4. Resolved the Problem

- Modified GPO:
- Removed `Domain Users` from ‚ÄúDeny log on locally‚Äù
- Or added `Domain Users` to ‚ÄúAllow log on locally‚Äù
- Re-applied policy with `gpupdate /force`
- Rebooted client
- Retested login ‚Üí ‚úÖ Success



 ‚úÖ Outcome

- `jthomas` was able to log in after correcting the misapplied logon restriction
- No changes were made to user or OU placement
- GPO was corrected, not removed ‚Äî maintaining proper policy enforcement



 üß† Lessons Learned

- GPO settings for login rights are common culprits in access issues
- `gpresult /r` is essential for confirming actual policy application
- GPMC allows you to audit filtering, security scope, and inheritance
- You should never delete a GPO in production ‚Äî always fix scope or security
- GPO misconfigurations can silently break user access without logging authentication failures
